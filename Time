const secondEvent = new ICalendar({

  title: 'Monthly Meeting with Boss Man',

  location: 'Conference Room 2A, Big Company, Brooklyn, NY',

  description: 'Meeting to discuss weekly things',

  start: new Date('2022-07-08T19:00:00'),

  recurrence: {

    frequency: 'MONTHLY'

  }

})

icalendar.addEvent(secondEvent)
